&lt;h2 id=&#34;enchiridion&#34;&gt;Enchiridion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;x&#34;&gt;X&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn
to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use. If you see
a fair man or a fair woman, you will find that the power to resist is
temperance (continence). If labour (pain) be presented to you, you will find
that it is endurance. If it be abusive words, you will find it to be
patience. And if you have been thus formed to the (proper) habit, the
appearances will not carry you along with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xi&#34;&gt;XI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never say about any thing, I have lost it, but say I have restored it. Is
your child dead? It has been restored. Is your wife dead? She has been
restored. Has your estate been taken from you? Has not then this also been
restored? But he who has taken it from me is a bad man. But what is it to
you, by whose hands the giver demanded it back? So long as he may allow you,
take care of it as a thing which belongs to another, as travellers do with
their inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xvii&#34;&gt;XVII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that thou art an actor in a play, of such a kind as the teacher
(author) may choose; if short, of a short one; if long, of a long one: if he
wishes you to act the part of a poor man, see that you act the part
naturally; if the part of a lame man, of a magistrate, of a private person,
(do the same). For this is your duty, to act well the part that is given to
you; but to select the part, belongs to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xxi&#34;&gt;XXI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let death and exile and every other thing which appears dreadful be daily
before your eyes; but most of all death: and you will never think of any
thing mean nor will you desire any thing extravagantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xxiii&#34;&gt;XXIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a man has reported to you, that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not
make any defence to what has been told you: but reply, The man did
not know the rest of my faults, for he would not have mentioned these only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xxxv&#34;&gt;XXXV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have decided that a thing ought to be done and are doing it, never
avoid being seen doing it, though the many shall form an unfavourable opinion
about it. For if it is not right to do it, avoid doing the thing; but if it
is right, why are you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xvii-1&#34;&gt;XVII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have assumed a character above your strength, you have both acted in
this matter in an unbecoming way, and you have neglected that which you might
have fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xliii&#34;&gt;XLIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every thing has two handles, the one by which it may be borne, the other by
which it may not. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold of the act
by that handle wherein he acts unjustly, for this is the handle which cannot
be borne: but lay hold of the other, that he is your brother, that he was
nurtured with you, and you will lay hold of the thing by that handle by which
it can be borne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xlvi&#34;&gt;XLVI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not speak much among the
uninstructed about theorems (philosophical rules, precepts): but do that
which follows from them. For example at a banquet do not say how a man ought
to eat, but eat as you ought to eat. For remember that in this way Socrates
also altogether avoided ostentation: persons used to come to him and ask to
be recommended by him to philosophers, and he used to take them to
philosophers: so easily did he submit to being overlooked. Accordingly if any
conversation should arise among uninstructed persons about any theorem,
generally be silent; for there is great danger that you will immediately
vomit up what you have not digested. And when a man shall say to you, that
you know nothing, and you are not vexed, then be sure that you have begun the
work (of philosophy). For even sheep do not vomit up their grass and show to
the shepherds how much they have eaten; but when they have internally
digested the pasture, they produce externally wool and milk. Do you also show
not your theorems to the uninstructed, but show the acts which come from
their digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xlviii&#34;&gt;XLVIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition and characteristic of an uninstructed person is this: he never
expects from himself profit (advantage) nor harm, but from externals. The
condition and characteristic of a philosopher is this: he expects all
advantage and all harm from himself. The signs (marks) of one who is making
progress are these: he censures no man, he praises no man, he blames no man,
he accuses no man, he says nothing about himself as if he were somebody or
knew something; when he is impeded at all or hindered, he blames himself: if
a man praises him, he ridicules the praiser to himself: if a man censures
him, he makes no defence: he goes about like weak persons, being careful not
to move any of the things which are placed, before they are firmly fixed: he
removes all desire from himself, and he transfers aversion
(ἔκκλισιν)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to those things only of the things within our power
which are contrary to nature: he employs a moderate movement towards every
thing: whether he is considered foolish or ignorant, he cares not: and in a
word he watches himself as if he were an enemy and lying in ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
1) Turning of one&amp;rsquo;s course, deflexion.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
